                 The type of business doesn't really matter, so get creative with it. This will be a static website, so it doesn't require the use of any JavaScript. However, if you want to go above-and-beyond, you're welcome to include some JavaScript too."</p></h3>

           <section><p>TLDR? Fine, I don't mind, maybe this isn't for you. Maybe you prefer comic books to novels. Whatever floats your, but please don't rock my, BOAT. (I like comics AND novels) I'm may not be as advanced as Moxie Marlinspike, but I appreciate his direction. I have to go to sleep each night with myself, being myself, not yourself. This is about myself, for those that may be interested, according to their interest. This is for my pleasure first, just like your facebook page is, and if it pleases you it pleases me all the more. If you don't enjoy this then close the page, click on something you do like, follow YOUR Bliss. This is me following mine. I'm old enough to know that I can't please everybody. I will make a serious effort not to cuss and curse.
               While I like to paint with all the colors, I'd rather not turn away good people with potty mouth. Aw snap.</p></section>

To quote Leonard Cohen's (makes <i>me</i> cry sometimes) song "HALLELUJA: "Now, I've heard there was a secret chord,
that David played, and it pleased the Lord,

                <h4 id="edutainment"> And you can get free refills all day, any day, for only 99 cents. Who I am is a mosaic of so many bits of good fortune, so many good people whom I've been lucky enough to know, know of, and/or know of their works. HALLELUJAH! In this, my own humble way, I hope to make a buck while offering you the opportunity to get "a penny for your thoughts" AND honor, by remembering and recalling the countless sources of inspiration that have filled my life my heart my mind and my time. Rabbitholes you say? Buy a book, a song, a whatever and support the people and projects that you find on this site. Apply the wisdom you glean, start a business, create value, beauty, laughter, sustainance, music, whatever. Production SOMETHING, anything good. No ideas of your own you say? Do like Derek Sivers and listen to what people are already asking for. That way you never have to <i>PUSH</i> a product. This is a form of edutainment for YOU. Edutainment by KRS-1 , great album, great guy. "If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics...."Disposeable Heroes of HipHopracy".
                This is almost like a new social media platform. Except for the fact that it's not. Know Your Customer? Nah. My customers know me and that is good enough. IF they want to share more than 99 cents with me, that is up to them. We can be conversant without involvng Conversant...and the Nosey Company of the year award goes to...Conversant.. now this is where I want to tell them to Fork Off but my lawyer said...HAHAHAHAHHA!</h4><br>

                <h4 id="PeaceSells"> Were gonna find out if Peace Sells. You'll know who's buying, unless they're buying with Bitcoin, or Zcash, or Dash, or Monero.    How in the heck did I get 15 sections built on this website before I mentioned <b>BITCOIN!?!?!</b> Ya know what? I'm not a doctor, or a lawyer or a financial advisor.  But do agree with whoever said that Blockchain technology is the most important discovery of the last 500 years. If the Electric lightbulb was the first application of electricity, Bitcoin, the currency is the first application of Blockshain technology, and just as electricity now has countless uses, most of which we take for granted, the  NON-CURRENCY applications of Blockchain technology are what really get me out of bed in the morning. Music and Politcs. Bananas and Chocolate. Technology and Choice. Wait a second, that last one is the name of a podcast that John Singleton spun off from the good work he did with Maidsafe, the worlds Oldest Startup, from Scottland.</h4><br>

                <h4 id="americoin"> You know what? THE FUTURE IS ALREADY HERE. I hope you're not one of those people I hear mellinials snicker about when they go "O M G, Everything about you is SOOOO 1900's. It's 2018 almost 2019 almost 2020. You know what that means? No I'm not talking about the Olypics in Japan but I'll be there. No I'm not talking about "Joint Vision 2020" the Empire's plan for "Full Spectrum Dominance" over the entire  electromagnetic spectrum of planet earth allowing them to effectively disable or deny any so-called adversaries use of anything having to do with, well, electricity or magnetism... which covers much of the essential services and a lot of the cool things that fill and satisfy our time, and needs. No, what I'm talking about Tunisia and Dubai being on track to have all of their government records online by 2020. Yeah Baby, Now that's a future worth realizing.
                    The corruption that happens when trusted third parties keep 2 or more copies of the books, the ledger, you know, corruption and all that middle man friction and graft? So long suckers, politic rats politicrats, middlemen, notarys...I kinda liked the notaries.

                <h4 id="fungold"> Maybe I'll make my own currency for this project, for this website, for this mkight be fun. Especially since, in like, 5 years from now, little kids, 7 year olds....Alice is going to make Alice Coin, and when Little Robbie wants to buy a $20 pack of top shelf origami paper from the nice lady at the Japanese market to make his paper cranes and dodoecahedrons, he's going to launch the project with an ICO in his 3rd grade class: $.50 for one token the first week, $.75 the next week, and $1.00 each when he makes them available to his savy customers at the farmer's market.  Putin is launching the crypto Ruble, Old News. Venezuela the Petro. Russian Burger King the Whopper coin, just embarrassing the US,  I mean come on, where's my McCoin already!?!?! Not that I'd baghold any of the Dirty Clown's coin, mind you.     Maybe I'll have to launch a coin.... I found videos that show you how to clone the sourcecode of your favorite coin from Github. In an hour or 2. No, I mean I found videos that, if you apply what they teach, you can make your own currency in a couple hours. Why not. 1500 other people have. Yep. What's that, something like one new currency every 2 days for the last 10 years..... and you STILL don't believe?!?!?!
                    well that's it for day one. Is this a blog or a website? It's everything I want it to be. and you get it all day all night (great song) for only 99 cents a month. I'm looking for a few thousand people with vision, and a buck they'll part with once a month. Whoa, I could do 1 year subscriptions for $9.99 a year.  or 7.89 if you pay with crypto. Hmmmmmmmmmmm. Good night, sleep tight, after I rest, I'll get up and write!</h4><br>

                    So this is where I tell everyone to start. In My Humble Opinion, (IMHO) this Blockchain thing, this Bitcoin thing, this Cryptocurrency thing, is about Never having to trust anyone with YOUR money EVER again. "Of all the Saints and Sages, who is the Most trustworthy? YOU. You're going to have to be like Elon Musk with this. Don't do this by analogy: Look at, learn for yourself the most Primitive facts about this subject: START WITH THE FIRST PRINCIPLES AND BUILD YOUR OWN, SOLID UNDERSTANING OF THIS PHENOMENAL TECH. Do your homework. Looking at the other kid's answers.... well, a fool and their money are soon parted, let me just put it like that.
