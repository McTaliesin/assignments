              <p>ABOUT FULLER
R. Buckminster Fuller was a 20th century inventor and visionary who did not limit himself to one field but worked as a 'comprehensive anticipatory design scientist' to solve global problems. Fuller's ideas and work continue to influence new generations of designers, architects, scientists and artists working to create a sustainable planet.

              <p>Ibn al-Haytham (a.k.a Alhaen) was the first to explain that vision occurs when light bounces on an object and then is directed to one's eyes.[17] He was also an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be proved by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical evidence—hence understanding the scientific method five centuries before Renaissance scientists.Here is one of Alhazen's sayings related to the scientific method:
"The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and,.. attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency."

              <img src="zimages/Averroes.jpg">
              <p>In Decisive Treatise, Averroes argues that philosophy—which for him represented conclusions reached using reason and careful method—cannot contradict revelations in Islam, because they are just two different methods of reaching the truth, and "truth cannot contradict truth".[62][63] When conclusions reached by philosophy appear to contradict the text of the revelation, according to Averroes must be subjected to interpretation or allegorical understanding in order to remove the contradiction.[62][59] This interpretation must be done by those "rooted in knowledge"—a phrase taken by from the Quran 3:7, which, for Averroes, refer to philosophers who during his time had access to the "highest methods of knowledge".[62][63] He also argues that the Quran calls for Muslims to study philosophy, as the study and reflection of nature would increase a person's knowledge of "the Artisan" (God).[64] He quotes Quranic passages calling on Muslims to reflect on nature, and used them to render a fatwa (legal opinion) that philosophy is not only allowed for Muslims, but even obligatory, at least among those who have the talent.[65]

Averroes also distinguishes three modes of discourse: the rhetorical (based on persuasion), accessible to the common masses; dialectical (based on debate), often employed by theologians and the ulama'; and demonstrative (based on logical deduction) which were employed by philosophers.[59][64] According to Averroes, the Quran uses the rhetorical method of inviting people to the truth, which allows it to reach the common masses with its persuasiveness.[66] Philosophy, on the other hand, uses the demonstrative methods which were only available to the learned but provided the best possible understanding and knowledge.[66]
