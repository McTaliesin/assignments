  "description": "--- This project was created as a starting point for React projects (using create-react-app) with Redux and Redux-Thunk. It is based off the tutorial [here](https://code.likeagirl.io/tutorial-for-adding-redux-to-a-react-app-1a94cc1738e5). The tutorial was meant as a guide and does not provide working code. This project follows that guide, with updates to eliminate bugs, and get the project fully running.",
