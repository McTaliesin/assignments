                <h4>TLDR?  That's fine, contact me directly and we'll talk. <br>
                1990   Restaurant work provided me autonomy and at Bob's Big Boy I alone was resposible for preparing keeping stocked everything for a full salad and BBQ bar.<br>
                1991   At the Wharehouse record store for a $.25 raise I moved up from clerk to shipping and recieving where I inventoried and labeled 60 -90 box shipments each week<br>
                1991   For a few months I worked 96 hours a week for the purpose of developing myself into a high capacity output person: 40 hrs/wk at the Warehouse, 40 hrs/wk at Golden West where I single handedly cooked all meals during the graveyard shift, and then just for fun, on my 2 days off I worked a retail position at Monterey's finest Surf Skate Ski shop.<br>
                1991 - 1998 I managed the Skateboard department at the Surf shop where I was responsible for ordering, merchandising, displays, and tuning skis and snowboards.<br>
                1998 - 2000 I worked in construction utilizing the skills gained from 2 years in a construction tech program that was offered in High School.<br>
                2000 -2002 I worked at The Monterey Bay Aquarium: One year in the Guest Services Dept. selling tickets and greeting the busses of tour goups and students during which I learned to say "Hello, Good Bye, and Thank You" in 20+ languages. I then worked for 14 months in the Visitor Presentations Dept.  as a "Splash Zone Facilitator spending 40hrs/wk in the coral reef exhibit where I answered questions for visitors, did sing along puppet shows for the kids, and was responsible for visitor safety. During that time out of 800 employees I won a company wide contest for customer service. My predecessors in that position lasted 6 and 9 months, some felt the job was high stress (not me!) and so much to my dismay the position was restructured with staff rotating through the exhibit for 1 hour shifts and spending the rest of the time asking people if they needed help at other exhibits. I bowed out.<br>
                2002 - 2007 I worked mostly in construction though between builds enjoyed various other temporary jobs including raw-organic-vegan food production, working as a s[potter atop a whale watching ship on Monterey Bay, I managed Kalisa's cafe on Cannery Row for a summer and opened up my own Coconut Shack in the back garden onto the bike trail, summer 2004 I ran my own business "Paradise Coconuts" serving fresh young Thai coconuts at the weekly farmer's market downtown: before coconut juice was a "thing" and available canned most everywhere.<br>
                2008 Myself, a gentleman from Zacatecas and 2 gents from Oaxaca built a $100,000+ house in Carmel, Ca from foundation to roof with forwards features such as rainwater sisterns, green roofs and solar panels.<br>
                2009 I spent the spring summer and fall managing a Lappert's "The Ice Cream Shoppe" in Pacific Grove which also housed a Beatles memorabilia museum with a vast and awesome collection on display.<br>
                2010 I was part of a 3 man crew that remodeled an old Victorian house for a family.
                2011 I moved to the northern part of Big Sur and did small construction and landscaping jobs to allow me to engage in vaious crative pursuits such as writing a 150 page book in 10 days which I hand bound over 100 copies. I then turned my binding skills towards making journals and notebooks: I look forwards to producing more now that I have the skills to build a proper website to allow me to offer them to the global market.<br>
                2013 While working at Hambrook's auction house and also at Monterey Bay Kayak's I came to learn of <b>BITCOIN.</b> I read Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper and spent the next month researching the subject to the point of forgetting to eat and sleeping little: This was the thing I had been waiting my whole life for.<br>
                2014 Continuing with construction and landscaping which allowed me to listen to podcasts all day (mostly about digital currency and finance and a lot of Tim Ferris), I took the train to Portland Oregon and bought a Skyhook brand BTM (Bitcoin Teller Machine) from the inventor and cofounder of the company. As I looked into the regulations for it's lawful operation in Cali, the state was threatening legislation similar to the New York bitcoin licencing act. By the time it did not pass, the company Skyhook had gone out of business and no one was updating the code which ran it. Today it makes a great doorstop and conversation piece.<br>
                2016 More of the same work while I bought an HP desktop computer from craigslist and installed a graphics card and Arch Linux over a long weekend. I was going to make of it an Ethereum mining rig... back when ETH was $6. After 2 months exhausing my bandwidth in failed attempts to download the entire ethereum blockchain and with no friends interested, I took a good construction job for the summer. Then the 2016 Big Sur Fire burned for 2 months resulting in me being evacuated from my home for 3 weeks. I spent the next year and a half helping 2 families rebuild what they had lost and in the fall of 2017 decided that to be a useful contributing member to the global blockchain community I would make a career change and go all in to become a developer.<br>
                <br>
                2018 I selected V School in Salt Lake City and enrolled in their 12 week Full Stack Developer course. One of the best decisions I've ever made. Know what I MERN?<br> 
                Here I bugun my study and use of JavaScript, React, Redux, Git, Express, MongoDB, Node.js, HTML, and CSS.<br>
