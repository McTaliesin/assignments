Game of Threes
28 AUGUST 2017
Today we will be building an app to play the games of three's.

Here's how you play:

Generate a random number.

If the number is divisible 3, divide it by 3

If it's not, either add 1 or subtract 1 (to make it divisible by 3), then divide it by 3

Repeat this process until you reach "1"
