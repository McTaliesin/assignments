// these aren't warmups. these are puzzles, quizes. once again, there goes the first
//hour of the day wasted on being challenged. how is that a warm up?
// doesn't work for me. I'm done wasting my time on what you call warmups.
// I came to learn, not be given a puzzle first thing in the morning.
// when I know how to do something, THEN it's fun to apply it.
// The great thing about math is that when you know how to  do one level of problems
// you can solve every problem of or below that level.
// Sorry if you don't like it but I'm done starting every day in a bad mood
// to try to please you. I'll come back and whip all of these warmups and more
// when I have a command of the skills to do so. Until then I will relentlessly
// pursue said skills by any means neccessary that works for me. I can't let your
// methods get in the way of my learning and understandin. I WILL see you at the
//finish line at or above the 50th percentile of this cohort. Yep.
