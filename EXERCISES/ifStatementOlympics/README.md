I've made mkdir README.md folders for every project and warm up.
I'm too far behind to do busywork making a folder for each of the folders in the exercise folder. I'll spend 2 more minutes googling it and If I can't find a command that automates the process I'll be happy with what I've done. I just cant see it being a good use of
time at this point. I'm also not sure why we didn't do this from the start. Is it some sort of weird test?   mkdir README.md mkdir README.md mkdir README.md mkdir README.md mkdir README.md
If there is a way to add a new README.md folder and file to each with a simple terminal command PLEASE SHOW ME! THANKS.
