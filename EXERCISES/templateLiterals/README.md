Template Literals


Write a function that will take location and name and output this if location="Hawaii" and name="Janice":

Hi Janice!

Welcome to Hawaii. 

I hope you enjoy your say. Please ask the president of Hawaii if you need anything.  
If you didn't do that with Template Literals, do it now with Template Literals.
