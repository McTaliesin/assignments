The answers below are my opinions, and as such, may change at any time when presented with better information
and even faster when I witness or experience situations to the contrary. My worldview is constantly upgrading and
auto-debugging from trial and error and experience.

School Job Search Plan of Action

1.Type of Work

Probably small to med. Large organizations get culturally weirder at the top, ivory towers, glass ceilings, power corrupting, etc
FOSS > Saas.    

I’d prefer to move to and work overseas for a few years, broaden my horizons and learn other languages; Mandarin, Python, Turkish, WebAssembly, Japanese, Elm, Singapore, Solidity...
And the terms of my employment are very negotiable and mostly determined by benefit to all of humanity (open source, non-coercive opt-in, everyones invited type of thing) and by who I’m working with:  I’ll pick my job the way kids used to pick their college: go check it out First, check out a few, and Then choose.

2. Polychronic time perhaps? Do You Experience Polychronic or Monochronic Time?

Polychronic means a culture does many things at once. Their concept of time is
free-flowing, and changes depending on each situation. Distractions and interrupt….

3.  Valid Passport and continually improving by quality and quantity of GitHub, as well as other projects on a website of my own design.  If Linked in has 500million linking in, I’m going another route.
4. For my delight, on my time, and for my personal projects, I’ll not use chrome which makes my CPU run at 164% due to google helper and the privacy extensions.  Nor will I use a service by the name of Job Track.  
   5. Never go solo to a meetup in a sketchy unknown part of town, like I did. Thursday, February 22, 2018

6. Coding Practice
I like this one and look forwards to it. When I can make time for such I’ll let you know how it turns out,

7.  I know that now, for almost every human activity, there is an app for that. I wonder if our industry
     might be encouraging an ADHD ADD feedback loop that might be getting worse?  Flashier apps with connected
features that you just can’t put down….. hmm.   I love the work, but I can’t ignore the ethical implications: I won’t
build stuff that hurts weakens poisons or dumbs down people.  I don’t want the stuff I want enough to make bad stuff even if its easy and or pays better.  A good night’s sleep is priceless, as are so many other things. For everything else, there’s bitcoin.

The Road Not Taken
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference



“SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. “

      So, personal computers morph into impersonal computer networks?   I don’t believe in or fear Skynet (Terminator movies?) but it is a good metaphor for the panopticon track trace control grid, one nation under surveillance. Has not history shown too many times what happens when too few control too much?  Who watches the watchers? Not the folks keeping us TV stats at 5.5 to 6.5 hours a day.  And here I thought labor saving devices were supposed to free mankind from the drudgery of mundane tasks that he and she might pursue loftier goals.   And Joe 6 pack is a demographic!?!?!   Facepalm.

Security is such an interesting topic.
Who can I trust to keep me secure?

If unfamiliar with the info below, perhaps read and research it by daylight. Truth is the first victim of war. Truth is stranger than fiction. That said.

From wikipedia, not a good source for university level thesis papers, but a great starting point for further research!

Quote me on saying “Don’t take my word for it, do your own research and come to your own conclusions”

For example if one goes to the European Parliament website “europarl” and types in “echelon”…..
http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/search?planet=portal&q=echelon

And, perhaps more interesting and less speculative, if one simply goes to “unesco” you know, educational arm of the U.N. UNESCO | Building peace in the minds of men and women
https://en.unesco.org/
And simply types “Huxley” into the search bar, and then clicks on the first and topmost result one finds Unesco’s founding document written by Julian Huxley: “UNESCO

“At the moment, it is probable that the indirect effect of civilisation is dysgenic instead of eugenic ; and in any case it seems likely that the dead weight of genetic stupidity, physical weakness, mental instability, and disease-proneness, which already exist in the human species, will prove too great a burden for real progress to be achieved. Thus even though it is quite true that any             radical eugenic policy            will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for Unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable. “

So that’s Julian Huxley, his brother Aldous Huxley wrote the novel “Brave New World”, the 1996 movie is rather interesting.

Brave New World is a dystopian novel by English author Aldous Huxley. Published in 1932, it propounds that economic chaos and unemployment will cause a radical reaction in the form of an international scientific empire that manufactures its citizens in the laboratory on a eugenic basis, without the need for human intercourse.
Set in a future London, it follows the fortunes of the illegitimate son of a senior governor, who has grown up in America, outside the new empire, and who experiences a dramatic culture-clash when he has to live under its rules. The novel anticipates developments in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation, and classical conditioning.

You may or may not know of the breeding project between the Huxleys Darwins Galtons and Wedgewoods. Same Wedgewoods famous for ceramics. Darwins as in Charles, and Galtons as in Sir Francis He was Charles Darwin's half-cousin.[10]He was a pioneer in eugenics, coining the term itself[3] and the phrase "nature versus nurture".[4] His book Hereditary Genius (1869) was the first social scientific attempt to study genius and greatness.[5]

I today for the first time noticed “Keynes” at the bottom of the stack… wait a min, the same fam as John Maynard Keynes?
YEP.
John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes[2] CB FBA (/keɪnz/ KAYNZ; 5 June 1883 – 21 April 1946), was a British economist whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments. He built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles, and was one of the most influential economists of the 20th century and the founder of modern macroeconomics theory.[3][4][5][6] His ideas are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics, and its various offshoots.
During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economicsthat held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.

I enjoy more the works of Friedrich Hayek CH FBA (/ˈhaɪək/; German: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈaʊ̯ɡʊst ˈhaɪɛk]; 8 May 1899 – 23 March 1992), born in Austria-Hungary as Friedrich August von Hayek and frequently referred to as F. A. Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist and philosopher best known for his defense of classical liberalism. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for his "pioneering work in the theory of moneyand economic fluctuations and ... penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena".[1]
Hayek was a major social theorist and political philosopher of the twentieth century,[2][3] and his account of how changing prices communicate information that helps individuals co-ordinate their plans is widely regarded as an important achievement in economics,[4] leading to his Nobel Prize.[5][6]

And  Ludwig Heinrich Edler von Mises[1] (/ˈmiːziːz/;[2][better source needed] German: [ˈluːtvɪç fɔn ˈmiːzəs]; 29 September 1881 – 10 October 1973) was an Austrian-American theoretical Austrian School economist. Mises wrote and lectured extensively on behalf of classical liberalism. He is best known for his work on praxeology, a study of human choice and action.
Mises emigrated from Austria to the United States in 1940. Since the mid-20th century, the libertarian movement in the United States has been strongly influenced by Mises's writings.[citation needed] Mises's student, Friedrich Hayek, viewed Mises as one of the major figures in the revival of liberalism in the post-war era. Hayek's work, "The Transmission of the Ideals of Freedom" (1951) pays high tribute to the influence of Mises in the twentieth century libertarian movement.[3]
Mises's Austrian School was a leading group of economists. Many of its alumni, including Hayek and Oskar Morgenstern, emigrated from Austria to the United States and Great Britain. Mises has been described as having approximately seventy close students in Austria,[4] and the Austrians as the insiders of the Chicago school of economics.[5] The Ludwig von Mises Institute was founded in the United States to continue his teachings.

But that’s just me, opinions are like old shoes and they all stink.

From

“There are three principal means of acquiring knowledge… observation of nature, reflection, and experimentation. Observation collects facts; reflection combines them; experimentation verifies the result of that combination.” – Denis Diderot
“Observation is a passive science, experimentation an active science.” – Claude Bernard
“The true method of knowledge is experiment.” — William Blake
‘Nothing has such power to broaden the mind as the ability to investigate systematically and truly all that comes under thy observation in life.’ — Marcus Aurelius
“Doubt the conventional wisdom unless you can verify it with reason and experiment.” – Steve Albini
“It vexes me when they would constrain science by the authority of the Scriptures, and yet do not consider themselves bound to answer reason and experiment.” – Galileo Galilei
“If I had thought about it, I wouldn’t have done the experiment. The literature was full of examples that said you can’t do this.” — Spencer Silver
‘Only those who attempt the absurd will achieve the impossible.’ — M. C. Escher
“All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson
“The real measure of success is the number of experiments that can be crowded into 24 hours.” — Thomas Alva Edison
‘When you’re experimenting you have to try so many things before you choose what you want, and you may go days getting nothing but exhaustion.’ — Fred Astaire
“It is only through failure and through experiment that we learn and grow.” — Isaac Stern
“The biggest job we have is to teach a newly hired employee how to fail intelligently. We have to train him to experiment over and over and to keep on trying and failing until he learns what will work.” – Charles F. Kettering
“No experiment is ever a complete failure. It can always be used as a bad example.” – Paul Dickson
“There is no such thing as a failed experiment, only experiments with unexpected outcomes.” – Richard Buckminster Fuller
“There are no failures – just experiences and your reactions to them.” – Tom Krause
“The true worth of an experimenter consists in his pursuing not only what he seeks in his experiment, but also what he did not seek.” –  Claude Bernard
“I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavours to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and interpreted in his favour in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of beings. In proportion as he simplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex, and solitude will not be solitude, nor poverty poverty, nor weakness weakness. If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.” – Henry David Thoreau
“The combination of experience and experimentation will ultimately yield a personal sound.” – Mark White
“I am my own experiment. I am my own work of art.” – Madonna
